**Cyber threat intelligence data acquisition platform leveraging shodan.io**

Long term goal is to support ingestion of ARIN CIDR blocks and then use those for searches.
Additionally moving to noSQL or mySQL will be preferred. Possibly even Elastic Search capabilities.

## Status: Highly experimental code
- April 2019 - This project is still in **very** early development, many features are highly volatile and subject to change. Please excuse the large amount of sloppy code and unused import statements. I am working to clean the code and include proper docstrings when possible.
